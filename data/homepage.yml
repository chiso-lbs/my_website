  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    The first thing to know about me is that I am a Bird, 
    and not a Frog (not yet a Polymath). I prefer to learn broadly, 
    across many disciplines, rather than observe the details of a sole field. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My areas of interest span Engineering, Finance, Psychology, Philosophy & History. Recently, 
    I have worked on analysing some data with R, which you will see below. Also, in addition
    to school work, I have been keeping up with the status of the porfolio companies in my investment
    partnership. A redacted version of my very first letter to partners can also be found below.
